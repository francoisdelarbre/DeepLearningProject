# DeepLearningProject
Project for the deep learning course, ULi√®ge 2019. The goal is to take part to the [2018 kaggle data science bowl](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018/data), see DL__project_proposal.pdf for more details.

We also included our final report (DL__project_report.pdf) and presentation slides (presentation.pdf).
